join
account_master am on am.customer_number=cm.customer_number
where am.account_status='terminated';





2.Write a query to display the number of customers who have registration but no account in the

the records sorted in ascending order based on transaction type.




select count(*) Trans_Count , tm.transaction_type from transaction_details tm
join
account_master am on am.account_number=tm.account_number
where am.customer_number like "%001" group by transaction_type order by transaction_type ;




4.Write a query to display the firstname of the customers who have more than 1 account. Display the

select count(cm.customer_number),cm.firstname,cm.customer_number from customer_master cm

group by cm.customer_number
having count(cm.customer_number)>1 order by cm.firstname;
